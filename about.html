          <h1>Hello there! Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>I am Atharv, an enthusiastic and dedicated engineering student with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Currently pursuing CSE branch at VIT, I am deeply engaged in exploring the intricacies of AI in python and Web Development and its applications in real-world scenarios.</p>

	<p>My academic journey is characterized by a relentless curiosity and a commitment to excellence. I have a strong foundation in key engineering principles, coupled with hands-on experience gained through various projects and internships. I thrive in challenging environments, where I can apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations and collaborate with like-minded individuals to devise creative solutions.</p>

	<p>As an aspiring engineer, I am driven by the belief that engineering is not just a profession but a mindsetâ€”a mindset that embraces challenges, values continuous learning, and strives to make a positive impact on society. I look forward to the exciting opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in my journey as an engineering student.</p>

          <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused
            communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application
            according to the user's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly
            with the user's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget.</p>
<p>Regards:)</p>
